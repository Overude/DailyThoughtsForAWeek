I didn't do my mobility workout for Sunday again...
But you know what, it's okay because I train in gym for 4 times a week
A 7 whole active workout would sculpt my body and give me much more strength.
Just like what I planned(Yet I'm not doing those 3 home workouts)
But you know what, it's okay again because I'm not competing for a fight like in UFC.

BTW here's a list of my favourite fighters in order by sports(based on their skills):
Boxing:
Bivol
Pacquiao
Gervonta
Marquez
Mayweather

UFC:
Jones
Makhachev
Gaethje
Adesanya
Grasso

This is also the day that my strongest phone got broke. Redmi, you're really a one durable phone.ðŸ«¡
